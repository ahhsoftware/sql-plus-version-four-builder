Hello fellow developers and welcome to version 4.

This version represents a complete rewrite of the tool, and includes many enhancements including:
* A new UI that simplifies setting up the build definition.
* Errors are now tracked and displayed prior to executing a build.
* Improved model structure for inputs, outputs, and services.
* Full documentation on all generated objects.
* Support for Nullable types (Optional Setting).
* IChangeTracking interface implementation (Optional Setting).
* IRevertibleChangeTracking interface implementation (Optional Setting)
* INotifyPropertyChanged interface implementation (Optional Setting)

To migrate an existing project, change the name of the "ConcreteQueries" folder to "Queries" prior to launching the extension.

Configure the remaining specifics about your build using the new UI, and when satisfied with your selections, run the builder.

Please keep us abreast of any problems.
